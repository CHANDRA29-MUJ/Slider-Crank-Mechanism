# Slider Crank Mechanism

This project showcases a slider-crank mechanism modeled and animated in Fusion 360. Itâ€™s one of the most common mechanisms used to convert rotary motion into linear motion, widely found in engines, compressors, and pumps.

##  Features

- Built entirely in **Fusion 360**
- Fully constrained using joints for smooth simulation
- Demonstrates complete rotary-to-linear motion transfer
- Exported in `.F3D`,and `.STEP` formats
- Includes animation preview in `.webm` format
